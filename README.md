## Introduction

Are you ready to set sail into the world of web app deployment? Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide is your passport to deploying Python web applications with style.

We've prepared two exhilarating examples, each showcasing a different platform's capabilities. Follow along, and soon you'll be deploying your Python web apps effortlessly.

## Vercel Deployment

### Prerequisites

- A Python web application using a framework like Flask, Django, or any other.
- [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/)
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli)

### Steps

1. **Create a Python Application**: Develop your Python web application locally.

2. **Version Control**: Ensure your project is under version control using Git.

3. **Install Vercel CLI**: If not already installed, run:

   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

4. **Login to Vercel**: Run `vercel login` and follow the instructions to log in.

5. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Create a `requirements.txt` file listing your Python dependencies.
   - Create a `vercel.json` file for deployment settings:

   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "vercel/",
         "use": "@vercel/python"
       }
     ],
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "vercel/app.py"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Customize paths as per your project structure.

6. **Deploy Your App**:
   - Run `vercel` in your project directory.
   - Confirm settings and choose a project name.
   - Vercel will build and deploy your Python app.

7. **Access Your App**: Once deployed, Vercel will provide a URL to access your app.

### Example App

For your convenience, an example Python app for Vercel is included in the `vercel/` folder. Dive into its README for a closer look.

## Railway Deployment

### Prerequisites

- A Python web application.
- [Railway account](https://railway.app/)
- [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/cli/installation)

### Steps

1. **Develop Your App**: Create your Python web app.

2. **Version Control**: Ensure your project is Git-tracked.

3. **Install Railway CLI**: If not already installed, run:

   ```
   npm install -g railway
   ```

4. **Login to Railway**: Run `railway login` and follow the instructions.

5. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Create a `requirements.txt` file listing your Python dependencies.
   - Ensure your project has a `Procfile` specifying how to run your app, e.g., `web: python railway/app.py`.

6. **Create a New Railway Project**:
   - Run `railway init` and choose a project name.
   - Link your local project to the Railway project.

7. **Deploy Your App**:
   - Run `railway up` to deploy your app.
   - Railway will handle the deployment process.

8. **Access Your App**: Railway will provide a URL to access your Python app.

### Example App

For your convenience, an example Python app for Railway is included in the `railway/` folder. Dive into its README for a closer look.

## Additional Resources

- Explore advanced deployment options and configurations in the respective platform's documentation.
- Join developer communities and forums to connect with others on their deployment journeys.
- Stay up to date with the latest trends in web development and deployment practices.
