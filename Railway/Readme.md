# Railway Python Web App Example

This README provides information about the Python web application example in the `railway/` folder. This example is meant to demonstrate how to deploy a Python app to Railway.

## Application Overview

The Python web app in this folder is a simple Flask-based web application. It serves as a minimalistic example to showcase how to deploy a Python app on Railway.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the example app up and running locally:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and Flask installed. You can install Flask using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Navigate to the `railway/` directory.
   - Run the following command to start the Flask development server:

     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

   - The app should now be running locally on `http://localhost:5000`.

3. **Access the App**: Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to view the app.

## Deploying to Railway

If you want to deploy this app to Railway, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Railway Project**:
   - Sign in to your Railway account.
   - Create a new project in the Railway dashboard.

2. **Install Railway CLI**: Ensure you have the Railway CLI installed. You can install it using `npm`:

   ```bash
   npm install -g railway
   ```

3. **Initialize Railway Project**:
   - Navigate to the `railway/` directory.
   - Run the following command to link your local project to the Railway project:

     ```bash
     railway init
     ```

   - Follow the prompts to select your project and environment.

4. **Deploy Your App**:
   - Run the following command to deploy your app to Railway:

     ```bash
     railway up
     ```

   - Railway will handle the deployment process and provide you with a URL where your app is hosted.

## Project Structure

- `railway/` - Contains the Python web application code.
  - `app.py` - The main Flask application.
  - `templates/` - Contains HTML templates.
  - `static/` - Contains static assets (CSS, images, etc.).

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates a basic Python web app that can be deployed to Railway. You can use this as a starting point for your own projects or experiment with deploying Flask apps on Railway.
