# Vercel Python Web App Example

This README provides information about the Python web application example in the `vercel/` folder. This example is meant to demonstrate how to deploy a Python app to Vercel.

## Application Overview

The Python web app in this folder is a simple Flask-based web application. It serves as a minimalistic example to showcase how to deploy a Python app on Vercel.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the example app up and running locally:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and Flask installed. You can install Flask using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Navigate to the `vercel/` directory.
   - Run the following command to start the Flask development server:

     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

   - The app should now be running locally on `http://localhost:5000`.

3. **Access the App**: Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to view the app.

## Deploying to Vercel

If you want to deploy this app to Vercel, refer to the main README for detailed instructions on deploying Python apps to Vercel.

## Project Structure

- `vercel/` - Contains the Python web application code.
  - `app.py` - The main Flask application.
